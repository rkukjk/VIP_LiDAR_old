    """
    This class manages all the clusters along with the algorithms to determine clusters. 
    Each clustering algo will take in a dataframe, which is the main dataframe with the results from the filtering section.
    Each clustering algo will output a list of signs that will be held by a SignManager object.

    """
    progressive_kdmean is a centroid based algorithm. It will take in the whole dataframe and go point by point. If there is a cluster whose centroid is within
    a certain distance away (threshold), then it adds it to the cluster. If no cluster exists, then it creates a new cluster and adds the points to the new cluster.
    The threshold is set a 1 meter, as I figured most signs are around about a meter or so wide.

    This method works fairly well if we are able to filter out points that probably don't belong to a sign.

    The columns for the pandas dataframe are as follows:

    ID, Easting, Northing, Altitude, Retro, Angle, Distance, UTC, Long, Lat, Pic

    Input: pandas dataframe
    Output: list of clusters
